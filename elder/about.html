                            <h3>To use the Music Track Player, start by selecting the key you wish to play along with. Next, select the music’s tonality (Major or Minor).  The last option to select will be the tempo. Here you have three choices (Slow, Medium or Fast). Once you have made your selections,  a random track will be selected for you to play along with based on your selections. If you have never practiced soloing or improvising before, don’t worry; we will provide diagrams of the guitar scales and chords to give you an easy to follow reference while you play. If you have any questions or if you would like to leave some feedback, please head on over to the feedback page. Have fun, and rock on!</h3>
